## Hey, Advait

These are the dotfiles you need for when you get a new pc.

This is optimized for Linux.

In your home directory:

First clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdvaitDhingra/dotfiles-linux

```
Then run the installation script:
```bash
bash install.sh
```
Watch it install everything you need
